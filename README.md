# Javascript Exercises
Write a function called multiply that takes two parameters and returns their product.
For example, if the function is called with multiply(2, 5),it should return 10.
# Write a function that flattens a nested array of any depth. The function should take an array as input and return a flattened version of that array. For example, if the input array is [1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6], the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. You should implement the function using recursion.
