2. Write a function that flattens a nested array of any depth. The function should take an array as input and return a flattened version of that array. For example, if the input array is [1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6], the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. You should implement the function using recursion.<br/>
3.  Write a function called reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string. For example, if the input string is "hello", the function should return "olleh". You should implement the function using a loop.<br/>
4.  Write a function called findMax that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array. For example, if the input array is [3, 5, 1, 7, 2], the function should return 7. <br/>
