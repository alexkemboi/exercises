# Javascript Exercises
1.  Write a function called multiply that takes two parameters and returns their product.
For example, if the function is called with multiply(2, 5),it should return 10.<br/>
2. Write a function that flattens a nested array of any depth. The function should take an array as input and return a flattened version of that array. For example, if the input array is [1, [2, [3, 4], 5], 6], the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. You should implement the function using recursion.<br/>
3.  Write a function called reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string. For example, if the input string is "hello", the function should return "olleh". You should implement the function using a loop.<br/>
4.  Write a function called findMax that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array. For example, if the input array is [3, 5, 1, 7, 2], the function should return 7. <br/>
5.  Write a JavaScript function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array. If the array is empty, return 0.
6.  Write a function that takes in a string and returns the number of vowels in the string. For this question, consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' to be vowels. For example, given the string "Hello, world!", the function should return 3, since there are three vowels in the string (two 'o's and one 'e').

169.    Given an array of nested arrays, write a function flatten that returns a flattened array containing all the elements from the original nested arrays.

For example, given the following input array:

javascript

const input = [1, [2, 3], [[4, 5], 6], 7];

The flatten function should return the following flattened array:

javascript

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Requirements

    The flatten function should take one argument: an array of nested arrays.

    The flatten function should return a flattened array containing all the elements from the original nested arrays.

    The flatten function should be able to handle an arbitrary number of nested arrays.

    The flatten function should not modify the original input array.

Example Usage

javascript

const input = [1, [2, 3], [[4, 5], 6], 7];
const result = flatten(input);
console.log(result); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Tips

    You can use recursion to handle an arbitrary number of nested arrays.

    The Array.isArray method can be used to determine if an element is an array.

    The concat method can be used to concatenate two arrays.

Bonus

Implement the flatten function using the reduce method.
